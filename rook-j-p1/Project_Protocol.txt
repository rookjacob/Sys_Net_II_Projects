 * @file httpServer.c		This file contains all of the function definitions for the functions used the the httpServer
 * program. Description on how the function works can be found in this file. Description of what the individual functions
 * do can be found in the httpServer.h file. The httpSever program is a program that is suppose to act as an HTTP/1.1
 * server to respond to clients that connect to the server using TCP. The program creates a listen socket to listen for
 * clients. When a client connects to the server, the server processes the message sent by the client and produces an
 * appropriate response to send to the client.
 *
 * Currently, the only HTTP/1.1 method supported by this server is the GET method. The server sends proper HTTP/1.1
 * status lines, however, the sending of the file requested currently does not work properly.


 * @file httpClient.c		This file contains all of the function definitions for the functions used the the httpClient
 * program. Description on how the function works can be found in this file. Description of what the individual functions
 * do can be found in the httpClient.h file.
 * 
 * The httpClient program is suppose to act as an HTTP/1.1 client that sends HTTP/1.1 GET requests to the server using TCP.
 * The httpClient program will ask the user for the IP address of the server and the file that the user wants from that 
 * server. Then the httpClient program will attempt to find and connect to that IP address. If connected, an HTTP/1.1
 * GET request will be produced and sent to the server. The response will be received by the httpClient program, interpreted,
 * and handled. If the file was successfully transfered to the client, the file will be downloaded with the same name but
 * with "Client_Copy_ to differentiate between the original files and transfered files. Once the file is downloaded, the
 * httpClient will open the file in the default browser for the user to see. 
 * 
 * NOTE: Currently the file transfer is not complete. Large file do not get downloaded properly and can not be opened 
 * successfully by the httpClient program. However, the httpClient can open some small files like text files because
 * they are downloaded correctly.
